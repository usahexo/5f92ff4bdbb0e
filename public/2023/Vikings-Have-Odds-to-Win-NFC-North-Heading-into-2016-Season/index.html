            <h1 id="Vikings-Have-Odds-to-Win-NFC-North-Heading-into-2016-Season"><a href="#Vikings-Have-Odds-to-Win-NFC-North-Heading-into-2016-Season" class="headerlink" title="Vikings Have Odds to Win NFC North Heading into 2016 Season"></a>Vikings Have Odds to Win NFC North Heading into 2016 Season</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings have the seventh-best odds to win the NFC North division heading into the 2016 NFL season, according to sports betting website Bovada.</p>
<p>The Packers are the favorites to win the division at -200 (meaning you would have to wager $200 on Green Bay to win $100), while the Vikings are at +350 (meaning a $100 bet would win $350).</p>
<p>Below are the odds for all four teams in the NFC North:</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers: -200<br>Chicago Bears: +1200<br>Detroit Lions: +1200<br>Minnesota Vikings: +350</p>
<h1 id="Vikings-Face-Long-Odds-to-Make-Playoffs-in-2016"><a href="#Vikings-Face-Long-Odds-to-Make-Playoffs-in-2016" class="headerlink" title="Vikings Face Long Odds to Make Playoffs in 2016"></a>Vikings Face Long Odds to Make Playoffs in 2016</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings open their 2016 NFL season with high expectations. After a disappointing 5-11 season in 2015, the Vikings revamped their coaching staff and added key free agents to improve their roster.</p>
<p>However, the odds are not in their favor to make the playoffs this year. In fact, according to ESPN’s Football Power Index (FPI), the Vikings have only a 26.3% chance of making the playoffs.</p>
<p>This is largely due to their difficult schedule. The Vikings will face off against eight teams that made the playoffs last year, including three of the four NFC playoff teams.</p>
<p>Their schedule also includes two games against Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers, as well as matchups against Cam Newton and the Panthers and Matt Ryan and the Falcons.</p>
<p>If they can manage to navigate through this tough schedule, they have a good chance of making the playoffs and competing for a Super Bowl championship.</p>
<h1 id="Las-Vegas-Sportsbooks-Report-Record-Bettting-on-Minnesota-Vikings"><a href="#Las-Vegas-Sportsbooks-Report-Record-Bettting-on-Minnesota-Vikings" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas Sportsbooks Report Record Bettting on Minnesota Vikings"></a>Las Vegas Sportsbooks Report Record Bettting on Minnesota Vikings</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings have created a lot of buzz this offseason, with the acquisition of QB Kirk Cousins and many expect them to be a contender in the NFC this season. According to reports from Las Vegas sportsbooks, this has led to record betting on the Vikings, with some books taking as much as 80% of their bets on Minnesota.</p>
<p>This isn’t too surprising, as the odds for the Vikings have been consistently dropping over the past few weeks. As of now, they are currently sitting as 5-1 favorites to win the Super Bowl, just behind the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>This is great news for the Vikings and their fans, but it could spell trouble for bettors if they don’t live up to expectations. The team does have a lot of talent and Cousins looks like he could be a good fit for them, but there are always surprises in the NFL.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about betting on the Vikings this season, it might be a good idea to wait until later in the year when the odds will be more favorable. There’s a good chance that they will still be one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl at that point, so you can make a lot more money by betting on them than you would if you placed your bet right now.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Calculate-the-Odds-When-Betting-on-Sports"><a href="#How-to-Calculate-the-Odds-When-Betting-on-Sports" class="headerlink" title="How to Calculate the Odds When Betting on Sports"></a>How to Calculate the Odds When Betting on Sports</h1><p>A lot of people enjoy betting on sports, but may not be sure how to calculate the odds. This article will walk you through how to do just that!</p>
<p>When looking to place a bet, the odds are one of the most important factors to consider. Odds represent the percentage chance that an event will happen, and can vary depending on the sport, league, and even game being played.</p>
<p>To calculate the odds, you will first need to know what they are in decimal format. To convert from fractional or US notation odds to decimal form, simply divide the odds by 100 (or use a online converter). For example, if you are looking at fractional odds of 4/1, this would be equal to (4/1) / 100 = 4.0 in decimal form.</p>
<p>Now that you have the decimal odds, it’s time to calculate your potential payout! Simply multiply your original stake by the decimal odds:<br>(Stake x Decimal Odds) = Payout<br>For example, if you placed a $10 bet at 4.0 decimal odds, your payout would be $40:<br>($10 x 4.0) = $40</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Odds-of-the-Minnesota-Vikings-Winning-the-Super-Bowl"><a href="#What-are-the-Odds-of-the-Minnesota-Vikings-Winning-the-Super-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="What are the Odds of the Minnesota Vikings Winning the Super Bowl?"></a>What are the Odds of the Minnesota Vikings Winning the Super Bowl?</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings have had an interesting season so far. They started out with a 5-0 record, then they went on a three-game losing streak, and they finished the regular season with a Wild Card win. After their victory over the New Orleans Saints, people are starting to wonder if they could go all the way and win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s still too early to tell what will happen in the playoffs. The Vikings could easily lose their next game against the Philadelphia Eagles. However, if they do manage to pull off another upset and win the Super Bowl, it would be a major accomplishment for them – and for their fans.</p>
<p>So what are the odds of that happening?</p>
<p>According to sports betting site Odds Shark, the Minnesota Vikigns have a 25% chance of winning the Super Bowl. This may not seem like very good odds, but it’s actually fairly respectable when you consider how many teams are in the playoffs.</p>
<p>In addition, there’s always a chance that one of the top teams could stumble – as we saw last year when the Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl. So don’t count out the Vikings just yet.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling confident about their chances, you can place a bet on them at Odds Shark. Just make sure you know what you’re doing first – this is not a game to be taken lightly!</p>
