With markdown, you can easily add headers, bullets lists, italics, and more to your content.

This can be incredibly helpful when you want to break up your content into easily digestible chunks. By adding headings and subheadings, you can help your readers quickly scan through your content and find the information they’re looking for. You can also use headings and subheadings as a way to add extra emphasis to certain points or ideas.</p>
<p> Additionally, markdown allows you go include links and images in your content with ease. Simply add the link or image URL in parentheses after the text you want to include, and it will automatically be included in your document. This makes it easy to add visuals and links into your content without having to worry about coding or embedding them manually.</p>
<h1 id="Why-should-I-use-markdown"><a href="#Why-should-I-use-markdown" class="headerlink" title="Why should I use markdown?"></a>Why should I use markdown?</h1><p>There are several reasons why you should consider using markdown when writing content: </p>
