The popularity of sports betting is on the rise with each day that goes by. Bettors around the globe are looking to place their bets on their favorite sport, and they’re doing so online. But when did this all start? And who deserves credit for creating one of the most popular activities in the world?

Online sports betting can be traced all the way back to 1994 when Intertops became the first online sportsbook. They allowed their customers to bet on sporting events through a telephone line. This was huge at the time, as it allowed people from all over the world to take part in sports betting.

#  How Long Has Sports Betting Been Around?

Since antiquity, humans have wagered on the outcomes of sporting events. Betting on sports is as old as sport itself. In fact, the first recorded instance of sports betting was from ancient Rome.

Back then, sporting contests were used to determine who would rule the empire. The people would bet on the outcomes of chariot races, foot races, and gladiator fights. Eventually, officials started regulating sports betting and casinos began popping up all over the place.

The earliest form of legalized gambling in what is now the United States was lotteries. The first ever U.S. lottery was held in 1768 in order to help fund public works projects like roads and bridges.

Lotteries were eventually outlawed in most states due to their addictive nature and propensity for fraud, but they remained popular fixtures in some regions of the country. It wasn’t until 1933 that betting on horse races was legalized in the US.

In 1961, Las Vegas became the first city in America to legalize casino gambling. This led to a explosion in legal sports betting throughout the country. Today, sports betting is a multibillion-dollar industry and is enjoyed by millions of people all over the world
