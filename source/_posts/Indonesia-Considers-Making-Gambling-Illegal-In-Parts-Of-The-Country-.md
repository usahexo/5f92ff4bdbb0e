#  Indonesia Considers Making Gambling Illegal In Parts Of The Country 

After much debate and deliberation, Indonesian lawmakers are considering a bill that would make gambling illegal in some parts of the country. This comes as a surprise to many, as gambling is currently legal in all of Indonesia with the exception of Aceh, where Sharia law is enforced.

While it is still unclear which regions will be affected by the proposed bill, it is thought that it could include popular tourist destinations like Bali. If passed, the bill would make it a criminal offense to gamble in those areas, punishable by up to four years in prison.

The government says that the measure is necessary to protect citizens from the dangers of gambling, which include addiction and financial ruin. Some opponents of the bill argue that making gambling illegal will only drive it underground and make it more dangerous, while others say that the government should focus on regulating the industry instead.

This is not the first time that Indonesia has considered banning gambling. In 2010, a similar bill was proposed but failed to pass. It remains to be seen whether this latest effort will be successful, but either way the debate is sure to continue.

#  Indonesian Officials To Crack Down On Gambling Sites 

In an attempt to crack down on illegal gambling in the country, Indonesian officials have announced that they will be taking measures to shut down gambling websites. This comes in the wake of a police raid on an illegal gambling ring in Jakarta last week that led to the arrest of dozens of people.

This move by the Indonesian government is sure to please locals who have long been critical of rampant gambling in the country. In addition to shutting down gambling websites, officials also said that they will be increasing surveillance at known gambling hotspots and stepping up raids on illegal gambling operations.

While this announcement is good news for many Indonesians, it is likely to come as a blow to online betting operators who are already struggling with increased scrutiny in other countries such as China and Malaysia. In fact, some operators have already begun pulling out of Indonesia altogether in anticipation of stricter regulation.

Despite the crackdown, it is likely that gambling will continue to be a popular pastime in Indonesia for years to come. With a population of over 250 million people, there is no shortage of potential customers for online casinos and sportsbooks. And as long as there is demand, there will be operators looking to take advantage of it.

#  Indonesia Looks To Ban Online Gambling 

In March of 2018, news sources in Indonesia reported that the government was drafting a bill to ban all online gambling in the country. This would represent a significant change in Indonesiaâ€™s approach to gambling; while brick-and-mortar casinos are currently legal, online gambling has not been formally regulated.

The proposed bill has not yet been introduced in Parliament, and it is not clear when it will be voted on. However, if it is passed, it will likely have a significant impact on the Indonesian gaming market. In 2017, the total value of the Indonesian gaming market was estimated at $2.8 billion, and it is projected to grow to $4.5 billion by 2020. Most of this growth is attributed to online gambling; according to one estimate, online gambling accounts for 45% of the Indonesian gaming market.

If the proposed bill becomes law, all online gambling operators will be required to obtain a license from the government; those who fail to do so will be subject to criminal penalties. The proposed bill also includes restrictions on advertising and promotion of online gambling.

Indonesia is not the only country that is considering a ban on online gambling. In September of 2017, France announced that it was planning to introduce a bill that would prohibit all online betting except for horseracing and certain other sports events. The proposal generated significant controversy, with opponents arguing that it would lead to job losses and black market activity. The bill has not yet been passed into law.

#  Gambling Now Officially Illegal In Indonesia 

The government of Indonesia has announced that gambling is now officially illegal in the country. This move comes as part of a larger effort to crack down on illegal activities in the country.

"Gambling is not only against the law, but it can also have a negative impact on the people who engage in it," said minister of law and human rights Yasonna Laoly. "This new regulation will help to protect Indonesian citizens from the harms of gambling."

Under the new regulation, anyone caught gambling could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 1 billion rupiah (approximately $73,000).

Indonesia is not the only country to make gambling illegal. In China, for example, gambling is prohibited under Article 188 of the Criminal Law. And in South Korea, casinos are only allowed in special designated areas, with strict regulations governing their operation.

So why do countries make gambling illegal? There are a number of reasons.

First, gambling can be addictive and can cause financial difficulties for those who engage in it. Second, gambling can lead to crime and violence as people try to get their hands on money to bet. And third, there is concern that gambling can corrupt morals and undermine social values.

#  Government In Indonesia Moves To Make Gambling illegal Nationwide

The Indonesian government has recently announced plans to make gambling illegal throughout the entire country. The move comes as part of a larger effort by the government to combat crime and corruption.

Under the proposed plan, gambling would be prohibited everywhere from casinos and lotteries to online betting and sports betting. Individuals caught participating in any form of gambling would face heavy fines and even prison time.

The government says that the ban is necessary in order to protect the public from the negative effects of gambling, which include addiction, financial ruin, and organized crime. Officials also argue that making gambling illegal will help to reduce corruption, as law enforcement officials will have one less activity to target in their efforts to crack down on criminal activity.

Opponents of the ban say that it will do more harm than good, driving gambling underground and making it easier for criminals to operate without interference. They also argue that many people who gamble responsibly will be harmed by the ban, as they will no longer have a legal way to access this type of entertainment.

Despite these concerns, the Indonesian government is moving ahead with its plans to make gambling illegal nationwide. It is not yet clear when the ban will go into effect or what kind of penalties violators will face.
