#  Precisely How to Dispute Online Casino Fees for Temple of Dead Game

In any event, you are a right thinking person and don't need to pay out $2.50 for your $1 deposit on Temple of the Dead. The methodology below is 100% guaranteed to work provided you utilize it step by step. 

The first thing you must do is find an email from the company that processes your bank card. This email will contain a PDF statement that shows the casino fees deducted from your account on the specific day you deposited money at the casino in question. The email will be sent to you automatically when the monthly statement is generated for your account. 

Open up the PDF statement and print it out. You can use any printer, but an inkjet printer works best so you can make a high quality copy. Once you have the copy, cut out just the fee charged by the casino and discard the rest of the statement. 

Next, take a blank sheet of paper and draw a line down the center of it vertically. At the top of the left hand column, write "Date Deposited" and leave plenty of space below it for notation. At the top of right had column, write "Amount Deposited" and leave plenty of space below it as well. 

Now comes the tricky part- creating a proof of purchase for your dispute letter. Underneath "Date Deposited," write "Casino Name- Temple of Dead." Underneath "Amount Deposited," write "$1." Now, get creative! You're going to have to make up some sort of documentation to support your case that you didn't actually spend $2.50 on this particular Temple of Dead game. 

Perhaps you could take a picture of your inkjet printed statement next to your bank statement? Or maybe even just hold up both statements next to each other so there's no question about what was deposited into which account? Be as convincing as possible; after all, this is going to be used as evidence in front of a judge if things go sideways with your dispute letter! 

Once you have created your proof-of-purchase, put everything in an envelope and mail it off to:
