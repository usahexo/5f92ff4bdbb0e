#  How to Deadhead Red Hot Poker Crops for Maximum Blooms 

If you are like many gardeners, you may enjoy growing red hot poker plants (Kniphofia uvaria). These perennials produce tall spikes of tubular flowers in shades of orange, yellow, and red that are a favorite among hummingbirds. While the plants are usually easy to care for, deadheading the blooms can help keep them looking their best.

#  Red Hot Pokers: Deadheading for a Second Bloom

The story of red hot pokers goes back centuries. Native to South Africa and parts of Africa, these plants were used by the native peoples as a remedy for various ills. Europeans first discovered them in the late 1700s, and soon after, they became popular garden plants.

Red hot pokers can be treated as either perennials or annuals, depending on your climate. In cooler climates, they will overwinter as perennials; in warmer climates, they will die back with the first frost but re-emerge in the spring as annuals.

No matter which way you treat them, though, one thing is always necessary: deadheading. Red hot poker flowers last only a few days, so if you want them to re-bloom, you need to remove the spent blooms. This is easy to do with a pair of sharp scissors â€“ just cut off the stem right at the base of the flower.

Do this once a week, and you should get a second bloom from your red hot pokers!
