If you are looking for an interesting and unique game to play, Tower of Fortuna Vanuatu is a great option. This ancient strategy game is believed to have originated in the Pacific islands and can be enjoyed by players of all ages. Here’s how to play:

The goal of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible by stacking coins on top of each other. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

To start, each player selects five coins to begin the game. Coins can be stacked in any direction, but must be placed adjacent to another coin. If a player cannot place a coin, they must forfeit their turn.

When stacking coins, the larger denomination coin should be placed on top of the smaller one. For example, if you are playing with a two dollar coin and a one dollar coin, the two dollar coin should be placed on top. If two or more coins have the same value, the player may choose which one to place on top.

In addition, players can use the following rules to score bonus points:

- If you stack three or more coins of the same value, you score 3 points plus 1 point for each additional coin (e.g., 4 coins = 7 points).
- If you can stack all five of your coins at once, you score 5 points. 
- If you stack a coin on top of an opponent's coin, your opponent loses 2 points and you gain 2 points. 
- If your opponent runs out of coins, they automatically lose the game. 

The first player to reach 21 (or another designated number) wins the game.
