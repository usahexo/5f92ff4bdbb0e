#  color of 21 in a roulette wheel shakespeare

A little-known fact about the color of 21 in a roulette wheel is that it was inspired by William Shakespeare. The story goes that a young Shakespeare attended a casino in France with a group of friends. While there, he became fascinated by the game of roulette and was particularly drawn to the color green, which represented the number 21 on the wheel.

When he returned to England, Shakespeare began incorporating references to green and 21 into his plays. For example, in his play Othello, he has Iago say "He hath disgrac'd me and hinder'd me half a million,laugh't at my losses, mock'd at my gains, scorned my nation, slandered my training." This line is thought to be a reference to Iago's envy of Othello's successful career as a general in the Venetian army.

Some scholars believe that Shakespeare may have even chosen the color green specifically because it was associated with 21 on the roulette wheel. Whether this is true or not is up for debate, but it's clear that the color of 21 holds significant meaning for Shakespeare and his fans.
